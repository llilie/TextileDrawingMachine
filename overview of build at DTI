We replicated the Textile Drawing Machine for use at the Design Thinking Initiative, Smith College.
Major changes included:
- Our machine has a width of 1000mm f
- We 3D printed the z-axis
- Some of our parts were metric and some were imperial, so some adaptations were made. A 3D printed wheel adapter was used to fit metric wheels to a 5/8th" axle.
